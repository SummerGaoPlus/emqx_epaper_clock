## Breaking changes

For JWT authentication, support new `disconnect_after_expire` option. When enabled, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires.

This option is enabled by default, so the default behavior is changed.
Previously, the clients with actual JWTs could connect to the broker and stay connected
even after the JWT token expired.
Now, the client will be disconnected after the JWT token expires.

To preserve the previous behavior, set `disconnect_after_expire` to `false`.
