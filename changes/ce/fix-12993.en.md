Fix listener config update API when handling an unknown zone.

Prior to this fix, when a listener config is updated with an unknown zone, for example `{"zone": "unknown"}`,
the change would be accepted, causing all clients to crash when connect.
After this fix, updating listener with an unknown zone name will get a "Bad request" response.
