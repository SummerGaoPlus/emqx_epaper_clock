The rule engine SQL-based language previously did not allow putting any expressions as array elements in array literals (only constants and variable references were allowed). This has now been fixed so that one can use any expressions as array elements.

The following is now permitted, for example:

```
select
  [21 + 21, abs(-abs(-2)), [1 + 1], 4] as my_array
from "t/#"
```
