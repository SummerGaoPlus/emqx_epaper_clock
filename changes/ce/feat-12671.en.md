An `unescape` function has been added to the rule engine SQL language to handle expansion of escape sequences in strings. This addition has been done because string literals in the SQL language don't support any escape codes (e.g., `\n` and `\t`). This enhancement allows for more flexible string manipulation within SQL expressions.
