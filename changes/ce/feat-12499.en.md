Added ability to ban clients by extended rules:
* by matching `clientid`s to a regular expression;
* by matching client's `username` to a regular expression;
* by matching client's peer address to an CIDR range.

Warning: large number of matching rules (not tied to a concrete clientid, username or host) will impact performance.
