Improve cluster discovery behaviour when a node is manually removed from a cluster using 'emqx ctl cluster leave' command.
Previously, if the configured cluster 'discovery_strategy' was not 'manual', the left node might re-discover and re-join the same cluster shortly after it left (unless it was stopped).
After this change, 'cluster leave' command disables automatic cluster_discovery, so that the left node won't re-join the same cluster again. Cluster discovery can be re-enabled by running 'emqx ctl discovery enable` or by restarting the left node.
