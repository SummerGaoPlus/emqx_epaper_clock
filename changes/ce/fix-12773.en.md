Upgrade HTTP client libraries.

The HTTP client library (`gun-1.3`) incorrectly appends a `:portnumber` suffix to the `Host` header for
standard ports (`http` on port 80, `https` on port 443). This could cause compatibility issues with servers or
gateways performing strict `Host` header checks (e.g., AWS Lambda, Alibaba Cloud HTTP gateways), leading to
errors such as `InvalidCustomDomain.NotFound` or "The specified CustomDomain does not exist."
